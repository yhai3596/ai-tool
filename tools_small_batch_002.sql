('ChemCrow', 'LangChain agent for chemistry-related tasks  ChemCrow is an open source package for the accurate solution of reasoning-intensive chemical tasks  It integrates 13 expert-design tools to augment LLM performance in chemistry and demonstrate effectiveness in automating chemical tasks  Built with Langchain  The LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected inputoutput. It is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation. One interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results. (Source: Weng, Lilian. (Jun 2023).

By fostering collaborative intelligence, CrewAI empowers agents to work together seamlessly, tackling complex tasks.  Crew AI is a multi-agent framework built on LangChain, aiming to empower engineers to harness the collective power of AI agents. In contrast to traditional automation methods, Crew AI introduces a new approach to collaborative decision-making, enhanced creativity, and solving complex problems.  The design philosophy of Crew AI advocates simplicity through modularity. Its main components include agents, tools, tasks, processes, and crews. Each agent is akin to a team member, possessing specific roles, background stories, goals, and memories. Through modular design, we make the intricate world of AI agents accessible, manageable, and more engaging.', 'https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'https://logo.clearbit.com/github.com', 'https://image.thum.io/get/fullpage/https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai', true, 6.5, 'data/remaining_github_tools.json'),
