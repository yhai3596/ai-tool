## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Missing Image Assets (Priority: HIGH)

**Problem:** 7 image assets were failing to load, causing broken mockups and testimonials

**Root Cause:** Images were stored in `/workspace/imgs/` but the application was looking for them in `/newsmith-ai-news/public/imgs/`

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `/newsmith-ai-news/public/imgs/` directory
- Copied all required images to the correct location:
  - ✅ `instagram_mobile_post_interface_mockup_template.jpg`
  - ✅ `linkedin_ad_mockup_feed_preview_professional.jpg` 
  - ✅ `meta_threads_mobile_post_mockup_light_dark_mode.jpg`
  - ✅ `diverse_professional_business_executive_headshots.jpg`
  - ✅ `diverse_professional_business_tech_executive_headshots.jpg`
  - ✅ `diverse_professional_business_headshots_collage.jpg`
  - ✅ `modern_social_media_app_icons_set.jpg`
- Generated new high-quality X/Twitter mockup to replace corrupted `threads_post_preview_9.jpg`

**Result:** All platform mockups and testimonial images now load properly

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Demo Authentication Not Working (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Landing page claimed "any email/password combination works for demo purposes" but all login attempts failed because it was using real Supabase authentication

**Solution Implemented:**

#### A. Created Demo Mode Dashboard
- **New Component:** `DemoDashboard.tsx` - Full-featured demo interface
- **Integration:** Uses existing `DemoMode.tsx` component with realistic sample data
- **Features:** All core functionality available without authentication

#### B. Updated Authentication Flow
- **Login Component:** Added prominent "Try Demo Mode" button
- **Landing Page:** "Watch Demo" button now navigates to actual demo
- **Routing:** Added `/demo` route that bypasses authentication

#### C. Enhanced User Experience
- **Clear Messaging:** Removed misleading "any email/password" text
- **Multiple Entry Points:** Users can access demo from login page or landing page
- **Professional Demo:** Includes sample AI news stories and generated content

**Result:** Users can now fully explore DailyByte functionality without signing up
