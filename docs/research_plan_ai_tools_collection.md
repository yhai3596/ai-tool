# AI Tools Data Collection Research Plan

## Objective
Collect comprehensive AI tools data from 6 major AI tool directory websites, extracting tool name, description, website link, and categories for each tool. Focus on diversity across different categories.

## Target Websites
1. https://www.toolify.ai/
2. https://www.futurepedia.io/
3. https://www.theresanaiforthat.com/
4. https://aitools.fyi/
5. https://topai.tools/
6. https://www.aixploria.com/en/free-ai/

## Data Requirements
For each tool:
- **name**: Tool name
- **description**: One-line description
- **website**: Website link/URL
- **category**: Category/tags

## Research Steps

### Phase 1: Website Analysis and Data Extraction
- [x] 1.1: Extract content from Toolify.ai - Partial success (got tool data but some missing descriptions)
- [x] 1.2: Extract content from Futurepedia.io - Failed (only got category overview)
- [x] 1.3: Extract content from TheresAnAIForThat.com - Success (comprehensive tool data)
- [x] 1.4: Extract content from AITools.fyi - Success (16 tools extracted)
- [x] 1.5: Extract content from TopAI.tools - Success (extensive tool list with categories)
- [x] 1.6: Extract content from Aixploria.com - Failed (only got platform description)

### Phase 2: Data Processing and Structuring
- [x] 2.1: Parse and structure extracted data from each website
- [x] 2.2: Standardize data format across all sources  
- [x] 2.3: Remove duplicates and ensure diversity across categories
- [x] 2.4: Compile final dataset with 147 unique AI tools from 4 sources

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance and Output
- [x] 3.1: Validate data completeness and accuracy - 147 unique tools successfully extracted
- [x] 3.2: Ensure diverse tool categories are represented - 73 tools with categories across 22+ categories
- [x] 3.3: Save final dataset to `data/directory_sites_tools.json` - Successfully completed

## Success Criteria
- Successfully extract tools from all 6 websites
- Maintain diversity across different AI tool categories
- Each tool record contains all required fields
- Final JSON file is properly formatted and complete

## Notes
- Focus on extracting a representative sample from each site
- Prioritize tools with complete information (all 4 required fields)
- Ensure category diversity: productivity, content creation, development, design, marketing, etc.
