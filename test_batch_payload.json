Tool Usage: Language agents in the library can use any external tools via function-calling and developers can add customized toolsAPIs here.  Web Navigation: Language agents in the library can use search engines to navigate the web and get useful information.  Multi-agent Communication: In addition to single language agents, the library supports building multi-agent systems in which language agents can communicate with other language agents and the environment. Different from most existing frameworks for multi-agent systems that use pre-defined rules to control the order for agents action, Agents includes a controller function that dynamically decides which agent will perform the next action using an LLM by considering the previous actions, the environment, and the target of the current states. This makes multi-agent communication more flexible.  Human-Agent interaction: In addition to letting language agents communicate with each other in an environment, our framework seamlessly supports human users to play the role of the agent by himselfherself and input hisher own actions, and interact with other language agents in the environment.  Symbolic Control: Different from existing frameworks for language agents that only use a simple task description to control the entire multi-agent system over the whole task completion process, Agents allows users to use an SOP (Standard Operation Process) that defines subgoalssubtasks for the overall task to customize fine-grained workflows for the language agents.",
